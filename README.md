Fisher's Iris

The Iris Fisher data set is composed of 150 observations, with 50 samples from each of the three species of Iris flowers
Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor. For each sample, four features were measured the length and width of both the sepals and petals in centimetres.

Analysis of Visuals

When plotting the sepal length versus the sepal width, we can gain insights into the relationship between these two features and how they may differ across the different species in the dataset.

The scatter plot reveals that there is a positive correlation between sepal length and sepal width, meaning that as the length of the sepal increases, so does the width. However, the relationship is not perfectly linear, and there is some variability in the data.

The three different species in the dataset can also be distinguished by their distribution in the scatter plot. The Setosa species appears to have the smallest sepal length and width, while the Versicolor and Virginica species have longer and wider sepals.

Furthermore, there is some overlap in the measurements between the Versicolor and Virginica species, which may make it more difficult to accurately distinguish between the two based on sepal length and width alone.

Overall, the scatter plot of sepal length versus sepal width provides useful insights into the Iris dataset and the different species within it. However, it is important to keep in mind that other features, such as petal length and width, may also be important for accurately classifying the different species.

The pair plot of the data provides a lot of insights into the relationships between these different features. Here is an analysis of a pair plot of the Iris Fisher dataset:

Sepal length and width: The scatter plot of sepal length and sepal width shows that there is a clear separation between Iris Setosa and the other two species. The plot suggests that Iris Setosa has smaller sepal width and shorter sepal length compared to the other two species. The plot also indicates that there is some overlap between the other two species in terms of sepal length and width.

Petal length and width: The scatter plot of petal length and petal width shows a clear separation between all three species. The plot indicates that Iris Setosa has smaller petals compared to the other two species. Moreover, Iris Virginica has larger petal width and length compared to Iris Versicolor, which has intermediate values.

Histograms: The histograms in the diagonal section of the plot provide insights into the distribution of each variable. The histograms suggest that sepal length and petal length have a bimodal distribution, indicating the presence of two distinct subpopulations. Sepal width and petal width have a more normal distribution.

Correlation: The pair plot indicates a strong positive correlation between petal length and petal width, which suggests that flowers with longer petals also tend to have wider petals. Similarly, there is a moderate positive correlation between sepal length and petal length, which suggests that flowers with longer sepals also tend to have longer petals.

Overall, the pair plot of the Iris Fisher dataset reveals that the different species can be clearly separated based on their sepal and petal measurements. The plot also suggests that there are some correlations between the different features measured. These insights can be used to guide further analysis of the dataset, such as building classification models to predict the species of a flower based on its measurements.
