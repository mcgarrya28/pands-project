Fisher's Iris

The Iris Fisher data set is composed of 150 observations, with 50 samples from each of the three species of Iris flowers
Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor. For each sample, four features were measured the length and width of both the sepals and petals in centimetres.

Analysis of Visuals
When plotting the sepal length versus the sepal width, we can gain insights into the relationship between these two features and how they may differ across the different species in the dataset.

The scatter plot reveals that there is a positive correlation between sepal length and sepal width, meaning that as the length of the sepal increases, so does the width. However, the relationship is not perfectly linear, and there is some variability in the data.

The three different species in the dataset can also be distinguished by their distribution in the scatter plot. The Setosa species appears to have the smallest sepal length and width, while the Versicolor and Virginica species have longer and wider sepals.

Furthermore, there is some overlap in the measurements between the Versicolor and Virginica species, which may make it more difficult to accurately distinguish between the two based on sepal length and width alone.

Overall, the scatter plot of sepal length versus sepal width provides useful insights into the Iris dataset and the different species within it. However, it is important to keep in mind that other features, such as petal length and width, may also be important for accurately classifying the different species.
