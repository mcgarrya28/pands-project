Fisher's Iris

The Iris Fisher data set is composed of 150 observations, with 50 samples from each of the three species of Iris flowers
Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor. 

For each sample, four features were measured the length and width of both the sepals and petals in centimetres.
